# ü•∫ A Little Request

## Please, please don't use this kernel for adapting KernelSU-Next~
üò≠üò≠üò≠

KernelSU-Next is NOT developed by the official KernelSU team, nor is it an officially endorsed improvement.
Also, its developer has done some really confusing and questionable things...

[Some Records](https://web.archive.org/web/20250211155215/https://github.com/rifsxd/KernelSU-Next/issues/145)

If you need similar functionality, please use **SukiSU**, okay?
It's much more stable and trustworthy!

## If you still insist on adapting it to KernelSU-Next...
I might actually burst into tears!!!
(ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)
Pleaseee~ Thank you so much!
